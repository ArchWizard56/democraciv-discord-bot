General-purpose Discord Bot with unique features designed for the r/Democraciv Discord. 

Provides useful information, political party & role management and much more. 

##  Requirements

*  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads//) 3.6 or newer
*  [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 1.2.5 or newer
*  A database with PostgreSQL 9.6 or newer

**Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.**

##  Installation

*As some features are implemented in a way to fit the very specific needs and use cases of the Democraciv Discord, it is not recommended 
to run the bot yourself as you might run into unexpected errors. Instead, invite the bot to your server with this
 [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=486971089222631455&scope=bot&permissions=8).*

After installing all the dependencies, create a `token.json` in the config folder.

The file should look like this:
```
 {
  "token": "INSERT_TOKEN_HERE",
  "twitchAPIKey": "INSERT_TWITCH_API_KEY_HERE",
  "postgresql-user": "INSERT_NAME_OF_YOUR_POSTGRES_USER_HERE",
  "postgresql-password": "INSERT_PASSWORD_OF_YOUR_POSTGRES_USER_HERE",
  "postgresql-database": "INSERT_NAME_OF_YOUR_DATABASE_HERE",
  "postgresql-host": "INSERT_ADRESS_OF_YOUR_DATABASE_HERE"
    
 }
```
Add the token of your Discord App, your Twitch Helix API key if you enabled the Twitch module, and your
 PostgresSQL configuration like above. Then, run `client.py`.

To use all of the bot's features, set the `democracivServerID` in `config.json` to a guild ID that the bot is in.


####  Database

This bot needs a PostgreSQL database to run. To install and configure PostgreSQL, head [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

The bot was tested with PostgreSQL 9.6 and 12.1, thus everything else in between should work.

####  Twitch 

If you want to use the Twitch announcements feature, you have to get an API key from [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
and add it to the `token.json` in the config folder.

You can configure everything else that is Twitch related in the `config.json`.

If you do not want to use the Twitch announcements feature, you have to set `enableTwitchAnnouncements` in the
`config.json` to `false`.

####  Reddit 

Notifications for new posts from a subreddit are enabled by default, but can be disabled in the `config.json`. Unlike the
Twitch Notification module, we don't need to register an API key for Reddit.

You can configure everything else that is Reddit related in the `config.json`.

If you do not want to use the Reddit announcements feature, you have to set `enableRedditAnnouncements` in the
`config.json` to `false`.
