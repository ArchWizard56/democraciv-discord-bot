[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/208984105310879744/embed.png)](http://discord.gg/j7sZ3tD) ![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%20%7C%203.7-yellowgreen) ![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2019)

General-purpose Discord Bot with unique features specially designed for the r/Democraciv community. 

Provides useful information, political party & role management and much more. 

## Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads//) 3.6 or higher
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 1.0.0 or higher

**Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.**

## Installation
After installing all the dependencies, create a `token.json` in the config folder.

The file should look like this:
```
 {
  "token": "INSERT_TOKEN_HERE",
  "twitchAPIKey": "INSERT_TWITCH_API_KEY_HERE"
 }
```
Add the token of your Discord App like above. Then, run `client.py`.

To use all of the bot's features, set the `democracivServerID` in `config.json` to a guild ID that the bot is in.


#### Twitch 

If you want to use the Twitch announcements feature, you have to get an API key from [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
and add it to the `token.json` in the config folder.

You can configure everything else that is Twitch related in the `config.json`.

If you do not want to use the Twitch announcements feature, you have to set `enableTwitchAnnouncements` in the
`config.json` to `false`.

#### Reddit 

Notifications for new posts from a subreddit are enabled by default, but can be disabled in the `config.json`. Unlike the
Twitch Notification module, we don't need to register an API key for Reddit.

You can configure everything else that is Reddit related in the `config.json`.

If you do not want to use the Reddit announcements feature, you have to set `enableRedditAnnouncements` in the
`config.json` to `false`.
